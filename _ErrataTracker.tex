Errata list / things to fix for Version 5.

%
1. Constant appearing in 6.5, #17. It's an integration problem, so it isn't technically *wrong*.
% Fixed 8/19/18

2. In Section 8.2, n^th partial sums need better definition. The formula implies that
S_n will add up terms r^0 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n, but this actually adds up n+1 terms. 
The geometric series portion should be rewritten. Not really used in the text, but it
influences answers at the back. (See email from Chuck Cusack.)

3. Page 6, line 3: refers to $\sin(x)/x$ when it should refer to $\sin(1/x)$.
% Fixed 8/20/18
