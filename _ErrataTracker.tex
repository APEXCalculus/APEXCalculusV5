Errata list / things to fix for Version 5.

%
1. Constant appearing in 6.5, #17. It's an integration problem, so it isn't technically *wrong*.
% Fixed 8/19/18

2. In Section 8.2, n^th partial sums need better definition. The formula implies that
S_n will add up terms r^0 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n, but this actually adds up n+1 terms. 
The geometric series portion should be rewritten. Not really used in the text, but it
influences answers at the back. (See email from Chuck Cusack.)

3. Page 6, line 3: refers to $\sin(x)/x$ when it should refer to $\sin(1/x)$.
% Fixed 8/20/18

pA.1 1.1#17: In the solution, the limit should seem to be exactly $-7$.
% Fixed 9/15/18


p74 02_01_exset_05: the enum counter resets (you \setcounter the wrong enum level?). also, inequalities 4 & 5 should be switched.
% Fixed 9/15/18    Used things like \item[(a)] to hard code the counter. Changed the > & < of parts (d) and (e) to match (a) and (b); answers already assumed that was the case.


p74 2.1#34 solution: g’=0 at x=0
% Fixed 9/15/18  Added $x=0$ to solution


pA.4 2.1#37: The solution should be negated.
% Fixed 9/15/18  Answer is now $-24$.

p82 2.3 para 2 line 2: “linear function” should be pluralized
% Fixed 9/15/18


p98 2.4#24: The solution should not have parts (b) or (c) (and no label ``(a)''). (I don’t think we added that in, but it’s not easy to check through your source for the exercises.)
% Fixed 9/15/18   Looks like this problem used to be used for a ``take the derivative two ways''
%  type problem, and now it is just a ``take the derivative'' problem.


p98 2.4#34: The solution should use $h’$, not $f’$.
% fixed 9/15/18, uses h'(t) instead of f'(x)


pA.6 2.6#29b solution: $+\sqrt[4]{108}$ should be $-\sqrt[4]{108}$.
% fixed 9/15/18  changes made 


p141 3.2 #3-10: In order to match Rolle's Theorem, the final $[a,b]$ should be $(a,b)$.
pA.6 3.2#23: 0 should not be included in the solution.
p173 4.1#15: The given problem has a unique solution at $x=0$.  The given solution works for $g(x)=\cos x+1$.
p179 4.2#4: ``circular'' should be ``spherical''.
p194 4.4#30 you probably want y instead of f(x)
pA.9 5.2#23 solution: The answer should be 22.
pA.9 5.2#25 solution: The answer should be 0.
p258 Example 5.5.8, Figure 5.5.14: Since you measured every 30 seconds, the time column should be labeled “Measurement #”.  Or you can leave it as time, but, e.g., change 7 to 3.5 min.
p281 6.1#36 solution: For $\abs x<1$, we need $\frac12 \ln\abs{\ln \left(x^2\right)}+C$ (absolute values).
pA.11 6.4#23 solution: $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}2\right)$ should be $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}3\right)$.
pA.12 6.7#13 Solution: Should be $2x\sech^2(x^2)$.
pA.12 6.8#3 Solution: Should have $\le10$ instead of $<10$.
p361 7.1#27-30: ``area triangle'' should be ``area of the triangle''.
p361 7.1#29: The solution should be 0, or a $(3,3)$ should become $(-1,3)$.
p361 7.1#30 solution: The area should be $\frac{21}2$.
p388 Example 7.5.1 solution line 2: ``it is'' should be ``is it''.
pA.13 7.5#5b solution: The answer is a length, so the units should just be ft.
p417 8.1#13-16: $a_n$ is multiply defined
p433 8.2#34a solution: should have the negative with $n$ odd, not $n$ even.
p433 8.2#36 solution: the series started at $n=1$, so it should be (a) $S_n=\dfrac{e^{-1}-e^{-n-1}}{1-e^{-1}}=\dfrac{1-e^{-n}}{e-1}$, (b) $\dfrac{e^{-1}}{1-e^{-1}}=\dfrac1{e-1}$.
p433 8.2#38a solution: $a_n = \frac12\left(\frac{1}{2n-1}-\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)$, so that $S_n=\frac12\left(1-\frac1{2n+1}\right) = \frac{n}{2n+1}$.
p441 8.3#22 solution: should specify $n\geq 3$ at the end, not $n\geq 2$.
pA.15 8.3#41a solution: $a_n/n<n$ should be $a_n/n<a_n$
pA.15 8.4#21 solution: $e^2$ should be $e^{-2}$.
p483 8.7#29-34 might want to ask for the $x^n$ term, since Taylor polynomials start with the 0th term.
pA.17 8.8#11 solution: The Taylor Series should be $\frac12+\sum_{n=1}^\infty$.
pA.19 9.2#45 solution: should be $t=k\pi$ for integral $k$.
pA.19 9.3#11 solution: a: The second term in the numerator should be doubled; b: The normal line is $y=-x$.
pA.19 9.3#29 solution: The intervals should be: concave up: $(-\pi/2,0)$; concave down: $(0,\pi/2)$.
p545 9.4#50 solution: $P(-1/2,\pi/3)$ should be $P(-1/2,2\pi/3)$
pA.20 9.4#53 solution: the origin is also a point of intersection
pA.34 14.3#17c solution: -1t should be t-1
p869 14.3#20d solution: 250 should be 0
pA.46 In Algebra / Factoring by Grouping, $(cs+d)$ should be $(cx+d)$.
pA.47 In Algebra / Taylor Series: should end with $+ . . .$
pA.47 In Algebra / Maclaurin Series: same

You mentioned that all exercise sets now start with an odd and end with an even.  There are a few sets with an odd number of problems:
01_04_exset_03
02_06_exset_02
04_04_exset_03
05_01_exset_01
05_01_exset_02
06_02_exset_03
06_03_exset_02
07_04_exset_04
08_07_exset_06
09_02_exset_09
10_04_exset_01
10_05_exset_05

also:
2.3#26 doesn’t seem to belong to that instruction set, leaving the set with an odd number of problems
7.1#19,20: These don’t really belong to their exercise set
10.2#21 throws off the parity

Grammar:
p423 8.2 just before Thm 8.2.2: $p$ is not in math mode
p496 8.8#12 solution: an open quote is never closed
p793 Def&Thm 13.4.2: (x_2,y_2) should have a comma after it

Misspellings.  The good news is I figured out how to spell check in my editor (and from the command line:
cat text/*tex | aspell list -t --ignore=3 --ignore-case | sort | uniq > misspell.txt
The bad news is I figured out how to spell check.

Multiple places: The units Newtons and Joules should be capitalized

Section 9.3
Section 10.5 x2
Section 11.1
Section 11.5 x5
Section 12.7
Section 14.1 x13 (plus two more commented out)
