Errata list / things to fix for Version 5.

%
1. Constant appearing in 6.5, #17. It's an integration problem, so it isn't technically *wrong*.
% Fixed 8/19/18

2. In Section 8.2, n^th partial sums need better definition. The formula implies that
S_n will add up terms r^0 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n, but this actually adds up n+1 terms. 
The geometric series portion should be rewritten. Not really used in the text, but it
influences answers at the back. (See email from Chuck Cusack.)

3. Page 6, line 3: refers to $\sin(x)/x$ when it should refer to $\sin(1/x)$.
% Fixed 8/20/18

pA.1 1.1#17: In the solution, the limit should seem to be exactly $-7$.
% Fixed 9/15/18


p74 02_01_exset_05: the enum counter resets (you \setcounter the wrong enum level?). also, inequalities 4 & 5 should be switched.
% Fixed 9/15/18    Used things like \item[(a)] to hard code the counter. Changed the > & < of parts (d) and (e) to match (a) and (b); answers already assumed that was the case.


p74 2.1#34 solution: g’=0 at x=0
% Fixed 9/15/18  Added $x=0$ to solution


pA.4 2.1#37: The solution should be negated.
% Fixed 9/15/18  Answer is now $-24$.

p82 2.3 para 2 line 2: “linear function” should be pluralized
% Fixed 9/15/18


p98 2.4#24: The solution should not have parts (b) or (c) (and no label ``(a)''). (I don’t think we added that in, but it’s not easy to check through your source for the exercises.)
% Fixed 9/15/18   Looks like this problem used to be used for a ``take the derivative two ways''
%  type problem, and now it is just a ``take the derivative'' problem.


p98 2.4#34: The solution should use $h’$, not $f’$.
% fixed 9/15/18, uses h'(t) instead of f'(x)


pA.6 2.6#29b solution: $+\sqrt[4]{108}$ should be $-\sqrt[4]{108}$.
% fixed 9/15/18  changes made 


p141 3.2 #3-10: In order to match Rolle's Theorem, the final $[a,b]$ should be $(a,b)$.
% fixed 9/15/18  changed to $(a,b)$


pA.6 3.2#23: 0 should not be included in the solution.
% 9/15/18 0 is removed


p173 4.1#15: The given problem has a unique solution at $x=0$.  The given solution works for $g(x)=\cos x+1$.
% 9/15/18  changed problem to $\cos(x) +1$ to match solution; probably initial intent


p179 4.2#4: ``circular'' should be ``spherical''.
% 9/15/18  yup.


p194 4.4#30 you probably want y instead of f(x)
%9/15/18  yup


pA.9 5.2#23 solution: The answer should be 22.
% fixed before 9/15; Troy?


pA.9 5.2#25 solution: The answer should be 0.
% fixed before 9/15; Troy?


p258 Example 5.5.8, Figure 5.5.14: Since you measured every 30 seconds, the time column should be labeled “Measurement #”.  Or you can leave it as time, but, e.g., change 7 to 3.5 min.
% 9/15/18  The label was changed to ``Time\\ (min)'' and the data is now time in minutes. 
% The text for the example was also altered to reflect the new data form.


p281 6.1#36 solution: For $\abs x<1$, we need $\frac12 \ln\abs{\ln \left(x^2\right)}+C$ (absolute values).
% 9/15/18   Changed the solution to $\frac{1}{2} \ln \left|\ln \left( x^2\right)\right|+C$ instead of worrying about when the inner \ln could be negative. More consistent with the integration step anyway


pA.11 6.4#23 solution: $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}2\right)$ should be $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x+2}3\right)$.
% 9/15/18  fixed


pA.12 6.7#13 Solution: Should be $2x\sech^2(x^2)$.
% 9/15/18  actually it is 6.6 #13. And fixed from sec to sech.


pA.12 6.8#3 Solution: Should have $\le10$ instead of $<10$.
% 9/15/18  Yes, changed to \leq 10


p361 7.1#27-30: ``area triangle'' should be ``area of the triangle''.
% 9/15/18  fixed


p361 7.1#29: The solution should be 0, or a $(3,3)$ should become $(-1,3)$.
% 9/15/18  changed third point to (-1,3)


p361 7.1#30 solution: The area should be $\frac{21}2$.
% 9/15/18  yes   $21/2$


p388 Example 7.5.1 solution line 2: ``it is'' should be ``is it''.
% 9/15/1 fixed


pA.13 7.5#5b solution: The answer is a length, so the units should just be ft.
% 9/15/18  yes; it was ft-lb


p417 8.1#13-16: $a_n$ is multiply defined
% 9/15/18 Fixed; instead of each being a_n, they are now d_n


p433 8.2#34a solution: should have the negative with $n$ odd, not $n$ even.
% 9/15/18  Yes


p433 8.2#36 solution: the series started at $n=1$, so it should be (a) $S_n=\dfrac{e^{-1}-e^{-n-1}}{1-e^{-1}}=\dfrac{1-e^{-n}}{e-1}$, (b) $\dfrac{e^{-1}}{1-e^{-1}}=\dfrac1{e-1}$.
% 9/15/18 Changed to sum starting with n=0. Makes more sense, instead of making it even harder.


p433 8.2#38a solution: $a_n = \frac12\left(\frac{1}{2n-1}-\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)$, so that $S_n=\frac12\left(1-\frac1{2n+1}\right) = \frac{n}{2n+1}$.
% 9/16/18 think this refers to #40a, not 38. Answer is correct in text.
% Wonder if suggestion is really about adding one more step between
% S_n and final answer.


p441 8.3#22 solution: should specify $n\geq 3$ at the end, not $n\geq 2$.
% 9/16/18  Yes, changed 2 to 3.


pA.15 8.3#41a solution: $a_n/n<n$ should be $a_n/n<a_n$
% 9/16/18  Yes, changed n to a_n.


pA.15 8.4#21 solution: $e^2$ should be $e^{-2}$.
% 9/16/18  Yes.


p483 8.7#29-34 might want to ask for the $x^n$ term, since Taylor polynomials start with the 0th term.
% REVISIT  Will look into other books' usage. May specify within book what the terms are.


pA.17 8.8#11 solution: The Taylor Series should be $\frac12+\sum_{n=1}^\infty$.
% 9/16/18  Fixed


pA.19 9.2#45 solution: should be $t=k\pi$ for integral $k$.
% 9/16/18  Fixed


pA.19 9.3#11 solution: a: The second term in the numerator should be doubled; b: The normal line is $y=-x$.
% 9/16/18 Fixed


pA.19 9.3#29 solution: The intervals should be: concave up: $(-\pi/2,0)$; concave down: $(0,\pi/2)$.
% 9/16/18 fixed


p545 9.4#50 solution: $P(-1/2,\pi/3)$ should be $P(-1/2,2\pi/3)$
% 9/16/18


pA.20 9.4#53 solution: the origin is also a point of intersection
% 9/16/18  added P(0,0) = P(0,\pi/6)$ as point of intersection


pA.34 14.3#17c solution: -1t should be t-1
% 9/16/18   fixed


p869 14.3#20d solution: 250 should be 0
% 9/16/18 fixed


pA.46 In Algebra / Factoring by Grouping, $(cs+d)$ should be $(cx+d)$.
% 9/16/18 already fixed


pA.47 In Algebra / Taylor Series: should end with $+ . . .$ and pA.47 In Algebra / Maclaurin Series: same
% 9/16/18 both fixed, plus other uses of ``...'' instead of ``\cdots'' on same page

Misspellings.  The good news is I figured out how to spell check in my editor (and from the command line:

The bad news is I figured out how to spell check.

Multiple places: The units Newtons and Joules should be capitalized
% 9/17/18 Pretty sure that no, they are not. Look at Wikipedia entry on Newton.
% Removed a few cases at first of capitalized Newton, used \emph{newton} and
% \emph{joule} for their first use.

I had forgotten a subtle point about l'Hopital's rule that is not mentioned in the book that stumped me for a while. I was trying to take the \lim x-->\infty (x^2+sin x)/x^2 as a student might (l'Hopital instead of algebra) and was confused when after the second application it failed to exist. I had forgotten that l'Hopital's rule only applies if the limit on the right exists. This is not stated in book and that can certainly cause misunderstandings since a student could draw the wrong conclusion (that the original limit does not exist). I would suggest maybe adding a phrase such as "assuming the limit on the right exists" in the two theorems.

In page 136, problem 14: The graph and the given function do not match! Please fix this in the next version!  Yes, the inside function is supposed to be x^4 - 2x^2+1. Somehow that mistake has lived on for a very long time.
% fixed 3/11/19

6.4 #23 has (x+2)/2 in the arctan, but it should be (x+2)/3.
% fixed (when?)

5.2. Number 23 and 25 answers in the back are off. 
% fixed (when?)

The solutions to 8.2 #31, 35, and 37 have r^n, but Theorem 8.2.1 has r^{n+1} , so one of these appears to be incorrect. I think the problem is Theorem 8.2.1 since the sum of the first n terms would be the sum from 0 to n-1, making r^n correct.


6, line 3, it is said that the function in figure 1.1.13(c) is sin(x)/x when the function is sin(1/x).

01_Limits_Involving_Infinity, line 238: I've added the following 
modifier at the end of the line: "for any positive integer $n$" since 
the statement is false for n less than or equal to zero.

03_Extreme_Values: when defining critical point, the text suggests that 
critical number and critical value are synonymous. Maybe I've done too 
much differential topology/geometry, but I consider critical number to 
be the x coordinate, while the critical value (i.e. function value) is 
the y coordinate.

03_Mean_Value_Theorem, line 104: there's a bit of awkwardness with the 
parenthetical remark and the preposition: "parallel with" makes sense, 
but between these two words there's (i.e. have the same slope), and I 
expect the next word to be 'as' rather than 'with'.
I've changed it to "parallel with (i.e. have the same slope as) the 
dashed line" in my version.

05_Riemann_Sums, line 59: "these rectangle" (missing an s at the end)

05_Definite_Integrals, line 144: "viewed a merely a" (first 'a' should

Page 415, Section 8.1,  Part  of Example 8.1.7: combined fraction should not have $n^2+4n+1$ but $n^2+3n$ in the numerator.
