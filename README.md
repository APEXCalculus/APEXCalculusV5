Source files for the APEX Calculus text, Version 5.0. 

Visit https://github.com/APEXCalculus/APEXCalculusV4 for the static repository of files that matches the print version. It is my intention to no longer update that repository.

All corrections to the errata of V4 will be made here in V5. There is currently no intended release date for V5. Hopefully it will make sense to keep V4 as the print version for several years.

The main file is Calculus.tex, intended to be run with XeLaTeX with the Calibri font. It will run without Calibri and with pdflatex, but the spacing will be different than intended. One can try using the Carlito font, which is an open font with (supposedly) the same font metrics as Calibri. I have not yet tried it personally.

CalculusI, CalculusII, CalculusIII and CalculusIII_star each typeset a portion of the text.
