      We have spent considerable time considering the derivatives of a function and their applications.
      In the following chapters,
      we are going to starting thinking in
      <q>the other direction.</q> That is,
      given a function <m>f(x)</m>,
      we are going to consider functions <m>F(x)</m> such that <m>F'(x) = f(x)</m>.
      There are numerous reasons this will prove to be useful:
      these functions will help us compute area,
      volume, mass, force, pressure, work, and much more.
