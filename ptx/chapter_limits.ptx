  <title>Limits</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Despite the wonderful advances in mathematics that had taken place into the first half of the <m>17^\text{ th }</m> century,
      mathematicians and scientists were keenly aware of what they <em>could not do.</em>
      (This is true even today.) In particular,
      two important concepts eluded mastery by the great thinkers of that time:
      area and rates of change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Area seems innocuous enough;
      areas of circles, rectangles, parallelograms,
      etc., are standard topics of study for students today just as they were then.
      However, the areas of <em>arbitrary</em>
      shapes could not be computed,
      even if the boundary of the shape could be described exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rates of change were also important.
      When an object moves at a constant rate of change,
      then <q>distance = rate <times /> time.</q>
      But what if the rate is not constant <mdash /> can distance still be computed?
      Or, if distance is known, can we discover the rate of change?
    </p>

    <p>
      It turns out that these two concepts were related.
      Two mathematicians, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz,
      are credited with independently formulating a system of computing that solved the above problems and showed how they were connected.
      Their system of reasoning was <q>a</q> calculus.
      However, as the power and importance of their discovery took hold,
      it became known to many as <q>the</q> calculus.
      Today, we generally shorten this to discuss <q>calculus.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The foundation of <q>the calculus</q> is the <em>limit.</em>
      It is a tool to describe a particular behavior of a function.
      This chapter begins our study of the limit by approximating its value graphically and numerically.
      After a formal definition of the limit,
      properties are established that make
      <q>finding limits</q> tractable.
      Once the limit is understood,
      then the problems of area and rates of change can be approached.
