  <title>Instantaneous Rates of Change: The Derivative</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A common amusement park ride lifts riders to a height then allows them to freefall a certain distance before safely stopping them.
      Suppose such a ride drops riders from a height of 150 feet.
      Students of physics may recall that the height
      (in feet)
      of the riders, <m>t</m> seconds after freefall
      (and ignoring air resistance, etc.)
      can be accurately modeled by <m>f(t) = -16t^2+150</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this formula, it is easy to verify that, without intervention,
      the riders will hit the ground at <m>t=2.5\sqrt{1.5} \approx 3.06</m> seconds.
      Suppose the designers of the ride decide to begin slowing the riders' fall after 2 seconds
      (corresponding to a height of 86 ft.).
      How fast will the riders be traveling at that time?
    </p>

    <p>
      We have been given a <em>position</em> function,
      but what we want to compute is a velocity at a specific point in time,
      i.e., we want an <em>instantaneous velocity</em>.
      We do not currently know how to calculate this.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we do know from common experience how to calculate an
      <em>average velocity</em>.
      (If we travel 60 miles in 2 hours,
      we know we had an average velocity of 30 mph.)
      We looked at this concept in <xref ref="sec_limit_intro">Section</xref>
      when we introduced the difference quotient.
      We have
      <me>
        \frac{\text{ change in distance } }{\text{ change in time } } = \frac{\text{ ``\ rise\ '' } }{\text{ run } } = \text{ average velocity } 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can approximate the instantaneous velocity at <m>t=2</m> by considering the average velocity over some time period containing <m>t=2</m>.
      If we make the time interval small,
      we will get a good approximation.
      (This fact is commonly used.
      For instance,
      high speed cameras are used to track fast moving objects.
      Distances are measured over a fixed number of frames to generate an accurate approximation of the velocity.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the interval from <m>t=2</m> to <m>t=3</m>
      (just before the riders hit the ground).
      On that interval, the average velocity is
      <me>
        \frac{f(3)-f(2)}{3-2} = \frac{f(3)-f(2)}{1} =-80\ \text{ ft/s } 
      </me>,
      where the minus sign indicates that the riders are moving <em>down</em>.
      By narrowing the interval we consider,
      we will likely get a better approximation of the instantaneous velocity.
      On <m>[2,2.5]</m> we have
      <me>
        \frac{f(2.5)-f(2)}{2.5-2} = \frac{f(2.5)-f(2)}{0.5} =-72\ \text{ ft/s } 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can do this for smaller and smaller intervals of time.
      For instance,
      over a time span of 1/10<m>^\text{ th }</m> of a second,
      i.e., on <m>[2,2.1]</m>, we have
      <me>
        \frac{f(2.1)-f(2)}{2.1-2} = \frac{f(2.1)-f(2)}{0.1} =-65.6\ \text{ ft/s } 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over a time span of 1/100<m>^\text{ th }</m> of a second,
      on <m>[2,2.01]</m>, the average velocity is
      <me>
        \frac{f(2.01)-f(2)}{2.01-2} = \frac{f(2.01)-f(2)}{0.01} =-64.16\ \text{ ft/s } 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we are really computing is the average velocity on the interval <m>[2,2+h]</m> for small values of <m>h</m>.
      That is, we are computing
      <me>
        \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h}
      </me>
      where <m>h</m> is small.
    </p>

    <p>
      We really want to use <m>h=0</m>,
      but this, of course, returns the familiar <q><m>0/0</m></q>
      indeterminate form.
      So we employ a limit,
      as we did in <xref ref="sec_limit_intro">Section</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can approximate the value of this limit numerically with small values of <m>h</m> as seen in <xref ref="table_falling">Figure</xref>.
      It looks as though the velocity is approaching <m>-64</m> ft/s.
      Computing the limit directly gives
      <md>
        <mrow>\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h} \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{-16(2+h)^2+150 - (-16(2)^2+150)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =  \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{-64h-16h^2}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to 0}(-64 -16h)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =-64</mrow>
      </md>.

    <p>
      Graphically,
      we can view the average velocities we computed numerically as the slopes of secant lines on the graph of <m>f</m> going through the points
      <m>(2,f(2))</m> and <m>(2+h,f(2+h))</m>.
      In <xref ref="fig_derivfalling">Figure</xref>,
      the secant line corresponding to <m>h=1</m> is shown in three contexts.
      <xref ref="fig_derivfalling">Figure</xref>(a) shows a <q>zoomed out</q>
      version of <m>f</m> with its secant line.
      In (b), we zoom in around the points of intersection between <m>f</m> and the secant line.
      Notice how well this secant line approximates <m>f</m> between those two points <mdash /> it is a common practice to approximate functions with straight lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      As <m>h\to 0</m>,
      these secant lines approach the <em>tangent line</em>,
      a line that goes through the point
      <m>(2,f(2))</m> with the special slope of <m>-64</m>.
      In parts (c) and (d) of <xref ref="fig_derivfalling">Figure</xref>,
      we zoom in around the point <m>(2,86)</m>.
      In (c) we see the secant line,
      which approximates <m>f</m> well,
      but not as well the tangent line shown in (d).
    </p>

      We have just introduced a number of important concepts that we will flesh out more within this section.
      First, we formally define two of them.

      Linear functions are easy to work with;
      many functions that arise in the course of solving real problems are not easy to work with.
      A common practice in mathematical problem solving is to approximate difficult functions with not<ndash />so<ndash />difficult functions.
      Lines are a common choice.
      It turns out that at any given point on the graph of a differentiable function <m>f</m>,
      the best linear approximation to <m>f</m> is its tangent line.
      That is one reason we'll spend considerable time finding tangent lines to functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      One type of function that does not benefit from a tangent<ndash />line approximation is a line;
      it is rather simple to recognize that the tangent line to a line is the line itself.
      We look at this in the following example.

          We find the slope of the tangent line by using <xref ref="def_derivative_at_a_point">Definition</xref>.
          <md>
            <mrow>\fp(1) \amp =  \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3(1+h)+5 - (3+5)}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3h}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  \lim_{h\to 0} 3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 3</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We just found that <m>\fp(1) = 3</m>.
          That is, we found the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
          of <m>f(x) = 3x+5</m> is <m>3</m>.
          This is not surprising; lines are characterized by being the
          <em>only</em> functions with a
          <em>constant rate of change.</em>
          That rate of change is called the
          <em>slope</em> of the line.
          Since their rates of change are constant,
          their <em>instantaneous</em> rates of change are always the same;
          they are all the slope.
        </p>

        <p>
          So given a line <m>f(x) = ax+b</m>,
          the derivative at any point <m>x</m> will be <m>a</m>;
          that is, <m>\fp(x) = a</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is now easy to see that the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x=1</m> is just <m>f</m>,
          with the same being true for <m>x=7</m>.
        </p>

    <p>
      We often desire to find the tangent line to the graph of a function without knowing the actual derivative of the function.
      In these cases,
      the best we may be able to do is approximate the tangent line.
      We demonstrate this in the next example.

      <title>Numerical approximation of the tangent line</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Approximate the equation of the tangent line to the graph of <m>f(x)=\sin x</m> at <m>x=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In order to find the equation of the tangent line,
          we need a slope and a point.
          The point is given to us: <m>(0,\sin 0) = (0,0)</m>.
          To compute the slope, we need the derivative.
          This is where we will make an approximation.
          Recall that
          <me>
            \fp(0) \approx \frac{\sin(0+h)- \sin 0}{h}
          </me>
          for a small value of <m>h</m>.
          We choose (somewhat arbitrarily) to let <m>h=0.1</m>.
          Thus
          <me>
            \fp(0) \approx \frac{\sin(0.1)-\sin 0}{0.1} \approx 0.9983
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus our approximation of the equation of the tangent line is <m>y = 0.9983(x-0) +0 = 0.9983x</m>;
          it is graphed in <xref ref="fig_tangentsinx">Figure</xref>.
          The graph seems to imply the approximation is rather good.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Recall from <xref ref="sec_limit_analytically">Section</xref>
      that <m>\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}x =1</m>,
      meaning for values of <m>x</m> near 0, <m>\sin x \approx x</m>.
      Since the slope of the line <m>y=x</m> is 1 at <m>x=0</m>,
      it should seem reasonable that <q>the slope of
      <m>f(x)=\sin x</m></q> is near 1 at <m>x=0</m>.
      In fact, since we <em>approximated</em>
      the value of the slope to be <m>0.9983</m>,
      we might guess the <em>actual value</em> is 1.
      We'll come back to this later.

    <p>
      Consider again <xref ref="ex_derv_point1">Example</xref>.
      To find the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>x=1</m>,
      we needed to evaluate a limit.
      To find the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>x=3</m>,
      we needed to again evaluate a limit.
      We have this process:

      This process describes a <em>function</em>;
      given one input
      (the value of <m>c</m>),
      we return exactly one output (the value of <m>\fp(c)</m>).
      The <q>do something</q> box is where the tedious work
      (taking limits)
      of this function occurs.

    <p>
      Instead of applying this function repeatedly for different values of <m>c</m>,
      let us apply it just once to the variable <m>x</m>.
      We then take a limit just once.
      The process now looks like:

      The output is the <q>derivative function,</q> <m>\fp(x)</m>.
      The <m>\fp(x)</m> function will take a number <m>c</m> as input and return the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>.

      The notation,

      A fraction<ndash />looking symbol was chosen because the derivative has many fraction<ndash />like properties.
      Among other places,
      we see these properties at work when we talk about the units of the derivative,
      when we discuss the Chain Rule,
      and when we learn about integration

            \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{1-1}{h} = \lim_{h\to0}0 =0

        <p>
          So far we have
          <me>
            \fp(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \cos x \amp  x\lt \pi/2\\ 0 \amp  x>\pi/2

        </p>

        <p>
          We still need to find <m>\fp(\pi/2)</m>.
          Notice at <m>x=\pi/2</m> that both pieces of <m>\fp</m> are 0, meaning we can state that <m>\fp(\pi/2)=0</m>.

        <p>
          Being more rigorous,
          we can again evaluate the difference quotient limit at <m>x=\pi/2</m>,

        <p>
          Since both the left and right hand limits are 0 at <m>x=\pi/2</m>,
          the limit exists and <m>\fp(\pi/2)</m> exists
          (and is 0).
          Therefore we can fully write <m>\fp</m> as
          <me>
            \fp(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \cos x \amp  x\leq\pi/2\\ 0 \amp  x>\pi/2

          See <xref ref="fig_piecewisecosx1">Figure</xref> for a graph of this function.

    </example>

    <p>
      Recall we pseudo<ndash />defined a continuous function as one in which we could sketch its graph without lifting our pencil.
      We can give a pseudo<ndash />definition for differentiability as well:
      it is a continuous function that does not have any <q>sharp corners.</q>
      One such sharp corner is shown in <xref ref="fig_absolutevalue">Figure</xref>.
      Even though the function <m>f</m> in <xref ref="ex_diff_piecewise">Example</xref> is piecewise<ndash />defined,
      the transition is <q>smooth</q>
      hence it is differentiable.
      Note how in the graph of <m>f</m> in <xref ref="fig_piecewisesinx1">Figure</xref>
      it is difficult to tell when <m>f</m> switches from one piece to the other;
      there is no <q>corner.</q>
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Differentiablity on Closed Intervals</title>
    <p>
      When we defined the derivative at a point in <xref ref="def_derivative_at_a_point">Definition</xref>,
      we specified that the interval <m>I</m> over which a function <m>f</m> was defined needed to be an open interval.
      Open intervals are required so that we can take a limit at any point <m>c</m> in <m>I</m>,
      meaning we want to approach <m>c</m> from both the left and right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall we also required open intervals in <xref ref="def_continuous">Definition</xref>
      when we defined what it meant for a function to be continuous.
      Later, we used one-sided limits to extend continuity to closed intervals.
      We now extend differentiability to closed intervals by again considering one-sided limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our motivation is three-fold.
      First, we consider <q>common sense.</q>
      In <xref ref="ex_deriv1">Example</xref>
      we found that when <m>f(x) = 3x^2+5x-7</m>, <m>\fp(x) = 6x+5</m>,
      and this derivative is defined for all real numbers,
      hence <m>f</m> is differentiable everywhere.
      It seems appropriate to also conclude that <m>f</m> is differentiable on closed intervals,
      like <m>[0,1]</m>, as well.
      After all, <m>\fp(x)</m> is defined at both <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, consider <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>.
      The domain of <m>f</m> is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
      Is <m>f</m> differentiable on its domain <mdash /> specifically,
      is <m>f</m> differentiable at <m>0</m>? (We'll consider this in the next example.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, in later sections,
      having the derivative defined on closed intervals will prove useful.
      One such place is <xref ref="sec_arc_length">Section</xref>
      where the derivative plays a role in measuring the length of a curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a formal definition of differentiability on a closed interval,
      we explore the concept in an example.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_diff_closed">
      <title>Differentiability on a Closed Interval</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>,
          and let the one-sided limits
          <me>
            \lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\text{ and } \lim_{h\to0^-}\frac{f(b+h)-f(b)}{h}
          </me>
          exist.
          Then we say <term><m>f</m> is differentiable on <m>[a,b]</m>.</term>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For all the functions <m>f</m> <em>in this text</em>,
      we can determine differentiability on <m>[a,b]</m> by considering the limits
      <m>\lim_{x\to a^+}\fp(x)</m> and <m>\lim_{x\to b^-}\fp(x)</m>.
      This is often easier to evaluate than the limit of the difference quotient.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_diff_closed1">
      <title>Differentiability at an endpoint</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}</m> and <m>g(x) = \sqrt{x^3}=x^{3/2}</m>.
          The domain of each function is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
          It can be shown that each is differentiable on <m>(0,\infty)</m>;
          determine the differentiability of each at <m>x=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We start by considering <m>f</m> and take the right-hand limit of the difference quotient:
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \amp = \lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{\sqrt{0+h}-\sqrt{0}}h</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{\sqrt{h}}h</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{1}{h^{1/2}}\ =\ \infty</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The one-sided limit of the difference quotient does not exist at <m>x=0</m> for <m>f</m>;
          therefore <m>f</m> is differentiable on
          <m>(0,\infty)</m> and not differentiable on <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We state (without proof) that <m>\fp(x) = 1/\big(2\sqrt{x}\big)</m>.
          Note that <m>\lim_{x\to0^+}\fp(x) = \infty</m>;
          this limit was easier to evaluate than the limit of the difference quotient,
          though it required us to already know the derivative of <m>f</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now consider <m>g</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h} \amp = \lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{\sqrt{(0+h)^3}-\sqrt{0}}h</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{h^{3/2}}h</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \lim_{h\to0^+}h^{1/2}\ =\ 0</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the one-sided limit exists at <m>x=0</m>,
          we conclude <m>g</m> is differentiable on its domain of <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig_diff_closed1">
          <caption>A graph of <m>y=x^{1/2}</m> and <m>y=x^{3/2}</m> in <xref ref="ex_diff_closed1">Example</xref>.</caption>
          <img src="figures/figdiff_closed1"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We state (without proof) that <m>\gp(x) = 3\sqrt{x}/2</m>.
          Note that <m>\lim_{x\to0^+}\gp(x) = 0</m>;
          again, this limit is easier to evaluate than the limit of the difference quotient.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two functions are graphed in <xref ref="fig_diff_closed1">Figure</xref>.
          Note how <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m> seems to <q>go vertical</q>
          as <m>x</m> approaches 0, implying the slopes of its tangent lines are growing toward infinity.
          Also note how the slopes of the tangent lines to
          <m>g(x)= \sqrt{x^3}</m> approach 0 as <m>x</m> approaches 0.
        </p>

    <p>
      Most calculus textbooks omit this topic and simply avoid specific cases where it could be applied.
      We choose in this text to not make use of the topic unless it is <q>needed.</q>
      Many theorems in later sections require a function <m>f</m> to be differentiable on an
      <em>open</em> interval <m>I</m>;
      we could remove the word <q>open</q>
      and just use <q><m>\ldots</m> on an interval <m>I</m>,</q>
      but choose to not do so in keeping with the current mathematical tradition.
      Our first use of differentiability on closed intervals comes in <xref ref="chapter_app_of_int">Chapter</xref>,
      where we measure the lengths of curves.

      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\ds f(x) = \cos\big(\sqrt{x}\big)</m>,<nbsp />domain =
          <m>[0,\infty)</m>,<nbsp /><m>\ds\fp(x) = -\frac{\sin\big(\sqrt{x}\big)}{2\sqrt{x}}</m>

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The limit of the difference quotient is difficult to evaluate.
          Using <xref ref="thm_special_limits">Theorem</xref>,
          we can determine <m>\lim_{x\to0^+}\fp(x) = -1/2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>\fp</m> is defined on <m>(0,\infty)</m>,
          we conclude <m>f</m> is differentiable on <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
