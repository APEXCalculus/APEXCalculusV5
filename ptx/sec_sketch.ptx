  <title>Curve Sketching</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have been learning how we can understand the behavior of a function based on its first and second derivatives.
      While we have been treating the properties of a function separately
      (increasing and decreasing, concave up and concave down, etc.),
      we combine them here to produce an accurate graph of the function without plotting lots of extraneous points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why bother?
      Graphing utilities are very accessible,
      whether on a computer, a hand<ndash />held calculator,
      or a smartphone.
      These resources are usually very fast and accurate.
      We will see that our method is not particularly fast <mdash /> it will require time
      (but it is not <em>hard</em>).
      So again: why bother?
    </p>

    <p>
      We are attempting to understand the behavior of a function <m>f</m> based on the information given by its derivatives.
      While all of a function's derivatives relay information about it,
      it turns out that <q>most</q> of the behavior we care about is explained by f '<nbsp />and f ''. Understanding the interactions between the graph of <m>f</m> and f '<nbsp />and f ''<nbsp />is important.
      To gain this understanding,
      one might argue that all that is needed is to look at lots of graphs.
      This is true to a point,
      but is somewhat similar to stating that one understands how an engine works after looking only at pictures.
      It is true that the basic ideas will be conveyed,
      but <q>hands<ndash />on</q> access increases understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following Key Idea summarizes what we have learned so far that is applicable to sketching graphs of functions and gives a framework for putting that information together.
      It is followed by several examples.

        To produce an accurate sketch a given function <m>f</m>,
        consider the following steps.

              Generally, we assume that the domain is the entire real line then find restrictions,

              <p>
                In determining the domain,
                we assume it is all real numbers and look for restrictions.
                We find that at <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=3</m>,
                <m>f(x)</m> is not defined.
                So the domain of <m>f</m> is <m>D = \{\text{ real numbers } x\ | \ x\neq -2,3\}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                To find the critical values of <m>f</m>,
                we first find <m>\fp(x)</m>.
                Using the Quotient Rule, we find
                <me>
                  \fp(x) = \frac{-8x+4}{(x^2+x-6)^2} = \frac{-8x+4}{(x-3)^2(x+2)^2}
                </me>.
                <m>\fp(x) = 0</m> when <m>x = 1/2</m>,
                and <m>\fp</m> is undefined when <m>x=-2,3</m>.
                Since f '<nbsp />is undefined only when <m>f</m> is,
                these are not critical values.
                The only critical value is <m>x=1/2</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                To find the possible points of inflection,
                we find <m>\fpp(x)</m>, again employing the Quotient Rule:
                <me>
                  \fpp(x) = \frac{24x^2-24x+56}{(x-3)^3(x+2)^3}
                </me>.
                We find that <m>\fpp(x)</m> is never 0
                (setting the numerator equal to 0 and solving for <m>x</m>,
                we find the only roots to this quadratic are imaginary)
                and f ''<nbsp />is undefined when <m>x=-2,3</m>.
                Thus concavity will possibly only change at <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=3</m>.

            <li>

                The vertical asymptotes of <m>f</m> are at <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=3</m>,
                the places where <m>f</m> is undefined.

    </example>

    <p>
      In each of our examples, we found a few,
      significant points on the graph of <m>f</m> that corresponded to changes in increasing/decreasing or concavity.
      We connected these points with straight lines,
      then adjusted for concavity,
      and finished by showing a very accurate, computer generated graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why are computer graphics so good?
      It is not because computers are
      <q>smarter</q> than we are.
      Rather, it is largely because computers are much faster at computing than we are.
      In general, computers graph functions much like most students do when first learning to draw graphs:
      they plot equally spaced points,
      then connect the dots using lines.
      By using lots of points,
      the connecting lines are short and the graph looks smooth.
    </p>

    <p>
      This does a fine job of graphing in most cases
      (in fact, this is the method used for many graphs in this text).
      However, in regions where the graph is very <q>curvy,</q>
      this can generate noticeable sharp edges on the graph unless a large number of points are used.
      High quality computer algebra systems,
      such as <em>Mathematica</em>,
      use special algorithms to plot lots of points only where the graph is <q>curvy.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="fig_mathematica_sinx">Figure</xref>,
      a graph of <m>y=\sin x</m> is given,
      generated by <em>Mathematica</em>.
      The small points represent each of the places
      <em>Mathematica</em> sampled the function.
      Notice how at the <q>bends</q>
      of <m>\sin x</m>, lots of points are used;
      where <m>\sin x</m> is relatively straight, fewer points are used.
      (Many points are also used at the endpoints to ensure the
      <q>end behavior</q> is accurate.)
      In fact, in the interval of length <m>0.2</m> centered around <m>\pi/2</m>,
      <em>Mathematica</em> plots 72 of the 431 points plotted;
      that is, it plots about 17<percent /> of its points in a subinterval that accounts for about 3<percent /> of the total interval length.
    </p>

    <sidebyside>
      <img src="figures/figmathematica_sinx"/>
    </sidebyside>

    <p>
      How does <em>Mathematica</em> know where the graph is <q>curvy</q>?
      Calculus.
      When we study <em>curvature</em> in a later chapter,
      we will see how the first and second derivatives of a function work together to provide a measurement of
      <q>curviness.</q> <em>Mathematica</em>
      employs algorithms to determine regions of <q>high curvature</q>
      and plots extra points there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, the goal of this section is not
      <q>How to graph a function when there is no computer to help.</q> Rather,
      the goal is <q>Understand that the shape of the graph of a function is largely determined by understanding the behavior of the function at a few key places.</q>
      In <xref ref="ex_sketch3">Example</xref>,
      we were able to accurately sketch a complicated graph using only 5 points and knowledge of asymptotes!
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many applications of our understanding of derivatives beyond curve sketching.
      The next chapter explores some of these applications,
      demonstrating just a few kinds of problems that can be solved with a basic knowledge of differentiation.

        <p>
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -x/y</m>,

        <p>
          <m>\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -1/y - x^2/y^3</m>,
          which is positive when <m>y\lt 0</m> and is negative when <m>y>0</m>.
          Hence the function is concave down in the first and second quadrants and concave up in the third and fourth quadrants.
