  <title>Continuity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have studied limits,
      we have gained the intuition that limits measure
      <q>where a function is heading.</q> That is,
      if <m>\ds \lim_{x\to 1} f(x) = 3</m>,
      then as <m>x</m> is close to 1, <m>f(x)</m> is close to 3.
      We have seen, though,
      that this is not necessarily a good indicator of what <m>f(1)</m> actually is.
      This can be problematic;
      functions can tend to one value but attain another.
      This section focuses on functions that
      <em>do not</em> exhibit such behavior.

      A useful way to establish whether or not a function <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>c</m> is to verify the following three things:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ds \lim_{x\to c} f(x)</m> exists,

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(c)</m> is defined, and
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ds \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c)</m>.

          We proceed by examining the three criteria for continuity.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The limits <m>\ds \lim_{x\to c} f(x)</m> exists for all <m>c</m> between 0 and 3.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(c)</m> is defined for all <m>c</m> between 0 and 3,
                <em>except for</em> <m>c=1</m>.
                We know immediately that <m>f</m> cannot be continuous at <m>x=1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The limit <m>\ds \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c)</m> for all <m>c</m> between 0 and 3, except,
                of course, for <m>c=1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          We conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous at every point of <m>(0,3)</m> except at <m>x=1</m>.
          Therefore <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(1,3)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our definition of continuity (currently) only applies to open intervals.
          After <xref ref="def_closed_continuity">Definition</xref>,
          we'll be able to say that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,1)</m> and <m>(1,3]</m>.

              <p>
                The limits <m>\lim_{x\to c} f(x)</m> do not exist at the jumps from one
                <q>step</q> to the next,
                which occur at all integer values of <m>c</m>.
                Therefore the limits exist for all <m>c</m> except when <m>c</m> is an integer.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          We conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere except at integer values of <m>c</m>.
          So the intervals on which <m>f</m> is continuous are
          <me>
            \ldots, (-2,-1), (-1,0), (0,1), (1,2), \ldots
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Our definition of continuity on an interval specifies the interval is an open interval.
      We can extend the definition of continuity to closed intervals by considering the appropriate one-sided limits at the endpoints.

    <p>
      We can make the appropriate adjustments to talk about continuity on half<ndash />open intervals such as <m>[a,b)</m> or <m>(a,b]</m> if necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this new definition,
      we can adjust our answer in <xref ref="ex_contint1">Example</xref>
      by stating that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,1)</m> and <m>(1,3]</m>,
      as mentioned in that example.
      We can also revisit <xref ref="ex_contint2">Example</xref>
      and state that the floor function is continuous on the following half<ndash />open intervals
      <me>
        \ldots, [-2,-1), [-1,0), [0,1), [1,2), \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This can tempt us to conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere;
      after all, if <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,1)</m> and <m>[1,2)</m>,
      isn't <m>f</m> also continuous on <m>[0,2)</m>?
      Of course, the answer is <em>no</em>,
      and the graph of the floor function immediately confirms this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuous functions are important as they behave in a predictable fashion:
      functions attain the value they approach.
      Because continuity is so important,
      most of the functions you have likely seen in the past are continuous on their domains.
      This is demonstrated in the following example where we examine the intervals of continuity of a variety of common functions.

                We cannot assume this implies that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>;

                It is easy to verify that this is indeed true,

      Because of this,
      the properties of limits found in <xref ref="thm_limit_algebra">Theorems</xref>

      A common way of thinking of a continuous function is that
      <q>its graph can be sketched without lifting your pencil.</q> That is,
      its graph forms a <q>continuous</q> curve,
      without holes, breaks or jumps.
      While beyond the scope of this text,
      this pseudo<ndash />definition glosses over some of the finer points of continuity.
      Very strange functions are continuous that one would be hard pressed to actually sketch by hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      This intuitive notion of continuity does help us understand another important concept as follows.
      Suppose <m>f</m> is defined on <m>[1,2]</m> and <m>f(1) = -10</m> and <m>f(2) = 5</m>.
      If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[1,2]</m> (i.e., its graph can be sketched as a continuous curve from <m>(1,-10)</m> to <m>(2,5)</m>) then we know intuitively that somewhere on <m>[1,2]</m> <m>f</m> must be equal to <m>-9</m>,
      and <m>-8</m>, and <m>-7,\ -6,\ \ldots,\ 0,\ 1/2</m>, etc.
      In short, <m>f</m> takes on all <em>intermediate</em>
      values between <m>-10</m> and <m>5</m>.
      It may take on more values;
      <m>f</m> may actually equal 6 at some time, for instance,
      but we are guaranteed all values between <m>-10</m> and 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this notion seems intuitive,
      it is not trivial to prove and its importance is profound.
      Therefore the concept is stated in the form of a theorem.
    </p>

      <title>Intermediate Value Theorem</title>

          without loss of generality, let <m>f(a) \lt f(b)</m>.
          Then for every value <m>y</m>,
          where <m>f(a) \lt y \lt f(b)</m>,
          there is at least one value <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>f(c) = y</m>.
              <idx><h>Intermediate Value Theorem</h></idx>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      One important application of the Intermediate Value Theorem is root finding.
      Given a function <m>f</m>,
      we are often interested in finding values of <m>x</m> where <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
      These roots may be very difficult to find exactly.
      Good approximations can be found through successive applications of this theorem.
      Suppose through direct computation we find that
      <m>f(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f(b)>0</m>, where <m>a\lt b</m>.
      The Intermediate Value Theorem states that there is at least one <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>f(c) = 0</m>.
      The theorem does not give us any clue as to where to find such a value in the interval <m>(a,b)</m>,
      just that at least one such value exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a technique that produces a good approximation of <m>c</m>.
      Let <m>d</m> be the midpoint of the interval <m>[a,b]</m> and consider <m>f(d)</m>.
      There are three possibilities:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(d) = 0</m>: We got lucky and stumbled on the actual value.
            We stop as we found a root.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(d) \lt 0</m>: Then we know there is a root of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[d,b]</m> <mdash /> we have halved the size of our interval,
            hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(d) >0</m>: Then we know there is a root of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,d]</m> <mdash /> again,we have halved the size of our interval,
            hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Successively applying this technique is called the
      <em>Bisection Method</em> 
          <idx><h>Bisection Method</h></idx>
      of root finding.
      We continue until the interval is sufficiently small.
      We demonstrate this in the following example.

        <p>
          Notice that in the 12<m>^\text{ th }</m> iteration we have the endpoints of the interval each starting with <m>0.739</m>.
          Thus we have narrowed the zero down to an accuracy of the first three places after the decimal.
          Using a computer, we have
          <me>
            f(0.7390) = -0.00014,  f(0.7391) = 0.000024
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Either endpoint of the interval gives a good approximation of where <m>f</m> is 0.
          The Intermediate Value Theorem states that the actual zero is still within this interval.
          While we do not know its exact value,
          we know it starts with <m>0.739</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This type of exercise is rarely done by hand.
          Rather, it is simple to program a computer to run such an algorithm and stop when the endpoints differ by a preset small amount.
          One of the authors did write such a program and found the zero of <m>f</m>,
          accurate to 10 places after the decimal, to be 0.7390851332.
          While it took a few minutes to write the program,
          it took less than a thousandth of a second for the program to run the necessary 35 iterations.
          In less than 8 hundredths of a second,
          the zero was calculated to 100 decimal places
          (with less than 200 iterations).

      It actually works very well to define a new function <m>g</m> where <m>g(x) = f(x) - 1</m>.
      Then use the Bisection Method to solve <m>g(x)=0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, given two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      we can use the Bisection Method to solve <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.
      Once again, create a new function <m>h</m> where
      <m>h(x) = f(x)-g(x)</m> and solve <m>h(x) = 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_newton">Section</xref>
      another equation solving method will be introduced, called Newton's Method.
      In many cases, Newton's Method is much faster.
      It relies on more advanced mathematics, though,
      so we will wait before introducing it.

    <p>
      This section formally defined what it means to be a continuous function.
      <q>Most</q> functions that we deal with are continuous,
      so often it feels odd to have to formally define this concept.
      Regardless, it is important, and forms the basis of the next chapter.

    <p>
      In the next section we examine one more aspect of limits:
      limits that involve infinity.

      The following exercises test your understanding of the Intermediate Value Theorem.
    </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be continuous on <m>[1,5]</m> where
          <m>f(1) = -2</m> and <m>f(5) = -10</m>.
          Does a value <m>1\lt c\lt 5</m> exist such that <m>f(c) = -9</m>?
          Why/why not?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes, by the Intermediate Value Theorem.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>g</m> be continuous on <m>[-3,7]</m> where
          <m>g(0) = 0</m> and <m>g(2) = 25</m>.
          Does a value <m>-3\lt c\lt 7</m> exist such that <m>g(c) = 15</m>?
          Why/why not?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes, by the Intermediate Value Theorem.
          In fact, we can be more specific and state such a value <m>c</m> exists in <m>(0,2)</m>,
          not just in <m>(-3,7)</m>.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be continuous on <m>[-1,1]</m> where
          <m>f(-1) = -10</m> and <m>f(1) = 10</m>.
          Does a value <m>-1\lt c\lt 1</m> exist such that <m>f(c) = 11</m>?
          Why/why not?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We cannot say;
          the Intermediate Value Theorem only applies to function values between <m>-10</m> and 10;
          as 11 is outside this range, we do not know.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>h</m> be a function on <m>[-1,1]</m> where
          <m>h(-1) = -10</m> and <m>h(1) = 10</m>.
          Does a value <m>-1\lt c\lt 1</m> exist such that <m>h(c) = 0</m>?
          Why/why not?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We cannot say;
          the Intermediate Value Theorem only applies to continuous functions.
          As we do know know if <m>h</m> is continuous, we cannot say.
