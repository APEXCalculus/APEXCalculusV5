  <title>Related Rates</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When two quantities are related by an equation,
      knowing the value of one quantity can determine the value of the other.
      For instance,
      the circumference and radius of a circle are related by <m>C=2\pi r</m>;
      knowing that <m>C = 6\pi</m>in determines the radius must be 3in.
    </p>

    <p>
      The topic of <em>related rates</em>
      takes this one step further:
      knowing the <em>rate</em> at which one quantity is changing can determine the
      <em>rate</em> at which another changes.

          The radius of a circle is growing at a rate of 5in/hr.
          At what rate is the circumference growing?

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The circumference and radius of a circle are related by <m>C = 2\pi r</m>.
          We are given information about how the length of <m>r</m> changes with respect to time;
          that is, we are told <m>\frac{dr}{dt} = 5</m>in/hr.
          We want to know how the length of <m>C</m> changes with respect to time,
          i.e., we want to know <m>\frac{dC}{dt}</m>.

        <p>
          As we know <m>\frac{dr}{dt} = 5</m>in/hr, we know

                We can answer this question two ways:
                using <q>common sense</q> or related rates.
                The common sense method states that the volume of the puddle is growing by <m>2</m>in<m>^3</m>/s, where

                volume of puddle <m>=</m> area of circle <times /> depth.

                Since the depth is constant at <m>1/8</m>in,
                the area must be growing by 16in<m>^2</m>/s.

                This approach reveals the underlying related<ndash />rates principle.
                Let <m>V</m> and <m>A</m> represent the Volume and Area of the puddle.
                We know <m>V= A\times \frac18</m>.
                Take the derivative of both sides with respect to <m>t</m>,
                employing implicit differentiation.
                <md>
                  <mrow>V \amp = \frac18A</mrow>
                  <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}\big(V\big) \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac18A\right)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} \amp =  \frac18\frac{dA}{dt}</mrow>
                </md>
                As <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 2</m>,
                we know <m>2 = \frac18\frac{dA}{dt}</m>,
                and hence <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = 16</m>.
                Thus the area is growing by 16in<m>^2</m>/s.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                To start, we need an equation that relates what we know to the radius.
                We just learned something about the surface area of the circular puddle,
                and we know <m>A = \pi r^2</m>.
                We should be able to learn about the rate at which the radius is growing with this information. 

                Implicitly derive both sides of
                <m>A=\pi r^2</m> with respect to <m>t</m>:
                <md>
                  <mrow>A   \amp = \pi r^2</mrow>
                  <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}\big(A\big) \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\big(\pi r^2\big)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\frac{dA}{dt} \amp = 2\pi r\frac{dr}{dt}</mrow>
                </md>
                Our work above told us that <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = 16</m>in<m>^2</m>/s.
                Solving for <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>, we have
                <me>
                  \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{8}{\pi r}
                </me>.
                Note how our answer is not a number,
                but rather a function of <m>r</m>.
                In other words,
                <em>the rate at which the radius is growing depends on how big the circle already is.</em>
                If the circle is very large,
                adding 2in<m>^3</m> of water will not make the circle much bigger at all.
                If the circle is dime<ndash />sized,
                adding the same amount of water will make a radical change in the radius of the circle.

                In some ways, our problem was (intentionally) ill<ndash />posed.
                We need to specify a current radius in order to know a rate of change.
                When the puddle has a radius of 10in,
                the radius is growing at a rate of
                <me>
                  \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{8}{10\pi} = \frac{4}{5\pi} \approx 0.25\text{ in/s } 
                </me>.

            </li>

      <title>Studying related rates</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Radar guns measure the rate of distance change between the gun and the object it is measuring.
          For instance, a reading of <q>55mph</q>
          means the object is moving away from the gun at a rate of 55 miles per hour,
          whereas a measurement of <q><m>-25</m>mph</q>
          would mean that the object is approaching the gun at a rate of 25 miles per hour.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the radar gun is moving (say,
          attached to a police car) then radar readouts are only immediately understandable if the gun and the object are moving along the same line.
          If a police officer is traveling 60mph and gets a readout of 15mph,
          he knows that the car ahead of him is moving away at a rate of 15 miles an hour,
          meaning the car is traveling 75mph.
          (This straight<ndash />line principle is one reason officers park on the side of the highway and try to shoot straight back down the road.
          It gives the most accurate reading.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose an officer is driving due north at 30 mph and sees a car moving due east,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig_rr3">Figure</xref>.
          Using his radar gun, he measures a reading of 20mph.
          By using landmarks,
          he believes both he and the other car are about 1/2 mile from the intersection of their two roads.

          If the speed limit on the other road is 55mph,
          is the other driver speeding?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using the diagram in <xref ref="fig_rr3">Figure</xref>,
          let's label what we know about the situation.
          As both the police officer and other driver are 1/2 mile from the intersection,
          we have <m>A = 1/2</m>, <m>B = 1/2</m>,
          and through the Pythagorean Theorem,
          <m>C = 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We know the police officer is traveling at 30mph;
          that is, <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = -30</m>.
          The reason this rate of change is negative is that <m>A</m> is getting smaller;
          the distance between the officer and the intersection is shrinking.
          The radar measurement is <m>\frac{dC}{dt} = 20</m>.
          We want to find <m>\frac{dB}{dt}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We need an equation that relates <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> and/or <m>C</m>.
          The Pythagorean Theorem is a good choice:
          <m>A^2+B^2 = C^2</m>.
          Differentiate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>A^2 + B^2 \amp = C^2</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}\left(A^2+B^2\right) \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left(C^2\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>2A\frac{dA}{dt} + 2B\frac{dB}{dt} \amp = 2C\frac{dC}{dt}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          We have values for everything except <m>\frac{dB}{dt}</m>.
          Solving for this we have
          <me>
            \frac{dB}{dt} = \frac{C\frac{dC}{dt}- A\frac{dA}{dt}}{B} \approx 58.28\text{ mph } 
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other driver appears to be speeding slightly.

        and explains why <q>in real life</q>
        the police officer would follow the other driver to determine their speed,
        and not pull out pencil and paper.

        The principles here are important, though.

          A camera is placed on a tripod 10ft from the side of a road.
          The camera is to turn to track a car that is to drive by at 100mph for a promotional video.
          The video's planners want to know what kind of motor the tripod should be equipped with in order to properly track the car as it passes by.
          <xref ref="fig_rr4">Figure</xref> shows the proposed setup.

        <p>
          How fast must the camera be able to turn to track the car?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We seek information about how fast the camera is to <em>turn</em>;
          therefore, we need an equation that will relate an angle <m>\theta</m> to the position of the camera and the speed and position of the car.
        </p>

        <p>
          <xref ref="fig_rr4">Figure</xref>
          suggests we use a trigonometric equation.
          Letting <m>x</m> represent the distance the car is from the point on the road directly in front of the camera, we have
          <men xml:id="eq_rr4">
            \tan \theta = \frac{x}{10}
          </men>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the car is moving at 100mph,
          we have <m>\frac{dx}{dt} = -100</m>mph
          (as in the last example,
          since <m>x</m> is getting smaller as the car travels,
          <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> is negative).
          We need to convert the measurements so they use the same units;
          rewrite <m>-100</m>mph in terms of ft/s:
          <me>
            \frac{dx}{dt} = -100\frac{\text{m} }{\text{ hr } } = -100\frac{\text{m} }{\text{ hr } }\cdot5280\frac{\text{ ft } }{\text{m} }\cdot\frac{1}{3600}\frac{\text{ hr } }{\text{s} } =-146.\overline{6}\text{ ft/s } 
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now take the derivative of both sides of Equation <xref ref="eq_rr4" /> using implicit differentiation:
          <md>
            <mrow>\tan \theta \amp = \frac{x}{10}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}\big(\tan \theta\big) \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{x}{10}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\sec^2\theta\,\frac{d\theta}{dt} \amp = \frac{1}{10}\frac{dx}{dt}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{d\theta}{dt} \amp = \frac{\cos^2\theta}{10}\frac{dx}{dt}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to know the fastest the camera has to turn.
          Common sense tells us this is when the car is directly in front of the camera (i.e., when <m>\theta = 0</m>).
          Our mathematics bears this out.
          In Equation <xref ref="eq_rr4b" /> we see this is when <m>\cos^2\theta</m> is largest;
          this is when <m>\cos \theta = 1</m>,
          or when <m>\theta = 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          With <m>\frac{dx}{dt} \approx -146.67</m>ft/s, we have
          <me>
            \frac{d\theta}{dt} = -\frac{1\text{ rad } }{10\text{ ft } }146.67\text{ ft/s }  = -14.667\text{ radians/s } 
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We find that <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt}</m> is negative;
          this matches our diagram in <xref ref="fig_rr4">Figure</xref>
          for <m>\theta</m> is getting smaller as the car approaches the camera.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is the practical meaning of <m>-14.667</m>radians/s?
          Recall that 1 circular revolution goes through <m>2\pi</m> radians,
          thus <m>14.667</m>rad/s means
          <m>14.667/(2\pi)\approx 2.33</m> revolutions per second.
          The negative sign indicates the camera is rotating in a clockwise fashion.

      We introduced the derivative as a function that gives the slopes of tangent lines of functions.
      This chapter emphasizes using the derivative in other ways.
      Newton's Method uses the derivative to approximate roots of functions;
      this section stresses the <q>rate of change</q>
      aspect of the derivative to find a relationship between the rates of change of two related quantities.

          A hot air balloon lifts off from ground rising vertically.
          From 100 feet away, a 5' woman tracks the path of the balloon.
          When her sightline with the balloon makes a 45<m>^\circ</m> angle with the horizontal,
          she notes the angle is increasing at about 5<m>^\circ</m>/min.

        <p>
          A company that produces landscaping materials is dumping sand into a conical pile.
          The sand is being poured at a rate of 5ft<m>^3</m>/sec;
          the physical properties of the sand,
          in conjunction with gravity,
          ensure that the cone's height is roughly 2/3 the length of the diameter of the circular base.
        </p>

        <p>
          How fast is the cone rising when it has a height of 30 feet?
